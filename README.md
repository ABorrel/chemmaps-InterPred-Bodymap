# Dependancies

## installtion with pip -> computation descriptor RDKIT developed in parrallel
$pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ CompDesc

## lib and sofwares
Development in python3.6 with
- Django
- RDKit (> 3.1): http://rdkit.org/docs/index.html
- molVS (> 1): https://molvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- Open Babel 3.0.0 (March 2020): (http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page) (sudo apt install openbabel) 
(additional some function will not work in case of no install)
- OPERA2.3_CL (https://github.com/kmansouri/OPERA/releases), fix the minor error in the install folder add a "/" at the path beginning
- OPERA will install PADEL in the same folder

## Upade the DSSTOX
Download chemicals from the pubchem
Current download => 866794 chemicals => limited to 500,000 structures
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pcsubstance?term=%22EPA%20DSSTox%22%5BSourceName%5D%20AND%20hasnohold%5Bfilt%5D
- with the mapping from the pubmed ID

# TO DO
## URGENT
- fix static file and check with docker version
- fix duplicate code for DB interaction 
- ~~Add QC data in bodymap~~
- Integrate tox21 assays results in chemmaps
- connection / close DB change in all of the project!!!
- Error in the name map for user page
- check adding in DB for descriptor user computation
- add new descriptor from OPERA 2.6 in the opera desc list
- load only once OPERA model
- add -999 value in case of descriptor NA
- remove descriptors in interpred
- create random int for folder for update in descriptor
- clean update folder 


### ChemMaps
#### Urgent 
- ~~Fix JS connect neighbor error when it is a uploaded chemicals -> done~~
- ~~Add DSSTOX in the DB and split map -> done use DB request and not split~~
- ~~Add command to upload a new chemical on the fly in the DB -> done~~
- ~~fix check in input and QSAR ready (09-20) -> done~~
- 508 html for all pages
- ~~fix table in case of very long chemical and size of the check figure -> done~~
- Add option to load characteristic on the map
- Fix the help page
- ~~For 508 change font tab~~
- ~~NaN in the panel tab~~
- ~~DrugMap png missing~~
- ~~508 add logo NTP on the map~~
- ~~07-11: error in load DSSTOXMAP~~ 
- ~~change contact information~~
- ~~Fix error with connect neighboor => change intersect JS~~
- ~~check case of chemical on drugmap and other map~~
- ~~Fix error with metal~~
- downloadDescFromDB, line 223 ERROR in coordinate run ==> need to check it is working
- Add option to not load in the DB the new chemicals as interferences

#### Improvement
- ~~Add distance in the neighbor file to download -> done~~
- Compute the 3D plan with several different plan
- change background in function of the map
- develop a carciMap choose on the 1600 chemicals and 1600 chemicals on the DSSTOX 
- Change color when chemicals are uploaded and rocket size
- italic for the article hyperlink + color blue


### Interferences
#### Urgent
- ~~Connect to a DB to increase speed~~
- ~~Update the descriptor computation and add a table of name from previous / new version (or reload model)~~
- ~~add header and footer for all of the page -> done~~
- ~~proof read page~~
- ~~check the 508~~
- ~~redo table for contrast and connect to the DB to save time of computation~~
- ~~remove MD compute inside the interferences code and make a table of connect for version 2.7 descriptor name and 3.6~~
- ~~Fix error reach several time the DB~~
- ~~case of name in input => add a regex before reach the DB~~
- ~~Add pop up for revision~~
- ~~Add link to Rmodel compressed and script R~~ 
- ~~Fix upload file path fail~~

#### Improvement
- Add in the table if the chemical is included in the trainning set
- Add a cross link with chemmaps and add an option


### BodyMap
#### Urgent
- ~~Add footer and header on each page -> done~~
- ~~Update the mapping with the assays mapping -> done~~
- ~~Fix a mapping on a body -> done~~
- ~~develop network mapping~~
- ~~fix the results page to generalize table~~
- check the 508 -> email to beth
- ~~Add the body mapping~~ 
- ~~fix legend barplot and inspect color => no real solution~~
- ~~change body pictures~~
- ~~fix highlight tab opened~~
- ~~fix download table~~
- ~~color dot on mapping gene map vs tissue map~~
- ~~add gene expression on table~~
- ~~add legend for network and bodymap dot~~
- ~~add link to chemmaps~~
- ~~add a tool tip: <em>"Ratio of specific tissue expression to all tissues for assay gene target. Higher cutoff = greater specificity"</em>~~
- ~~make a autocomplete form~~
- ~~write home and help pages~~
- ~~label organs directly on the png~~
- ~~add name of the chemical on the network => added name in the autocompletion form~~
- ~~correct the chemical selection to chose a chemical by name, repetition, alphabetic order~~
- add one color for the mapping in case of mapping using both tissues and gene
- correct the barplot
- improve the network by adding some cutoff on the AC50 and gene expression.


### Development of a admin toolbox
- update chemical DB with 
- update coordinates 
- control DB with entries and quality
- compute on the fly descriptor and OPERA prediction
